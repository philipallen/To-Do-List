You will need mongodb installed
TODO: Add how to connect to mongodb.

To set up this project:
1. Start the Mongo DB by navigating here: C:\mongo\bin and starting mongod.exe
2. Go to server.js, right click and "Run"
3. Go to index.html, right click and "Run"

That's it - it should load in the browser.

To set up debug mode:
Same as above but run server.js and index.html as debug

To see what's in the mongodb database: http://localhost:3000/
